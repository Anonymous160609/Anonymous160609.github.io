            the Assessment of Agent-based Model

    <div class="paragraph" id="intro">
        Introduction:
            <p>
                It is the first attempt in Agent-based Model for me as an urban planner. 
                I tended to understand and explain the process of urbanization as 
                "an instance of temporal-serial signals of individual person". 
                Now I can fairly and confidently say that urbanization can be systematically modeled by ABM:
                In essence it is the interaction of agents (residents) within the envionemnt (cities). 
                A continue study in ABM would definately improve my capabilities to understand 
                complicated urban planning concepts and processes.

        Brief of the Code:
            <p>
                It is an agent-based model including animated displays, real-time statistics in model , 
                and parameter passings in interface. 
                For a defined duration it simulates the movements of sheep and wolf, 
                as well as their interactions between with grassland.
                Sheep and wolf will move around grassland. Sheep can consume and store grass, 
                then average their grass sotre with other sheep nearby.
                Wolf can prey sheep, turn their colours into red, and stop movements of sheep.
                <br/> 
                <br/>
                Initializing the model.py in spyder, it will show its UI. 
                Users can input parameters in the left panel then confirm and/or run model through buttons.
                When it runs, it is expected to show interactions between sheep, wolf, and grassland, 
                both in form of animation and statistics.

    <div class="paragraph" id="defi">
        Defination of ABM:
            <p>
                Agent-based Model simulates individual bodies' (agents') movements 
                and interactions within in a given environment (wiki). 
                It emphasizes randomness in each interaction and helps understand detailed, 
                specific situations which would not be examinated and discussed 
                by triditioanl methodologies e.g. regression.

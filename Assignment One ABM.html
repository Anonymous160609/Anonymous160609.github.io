            It is the first attempt in Agent-based Model for me as an urban planner. 
            I tended to understand and explain the process of urbanization as 
            "an instance of temporal-serial signals of individual person". 
            Now I can fairly and confidently say that urbanization can be systematically modeled by ABM:
            In essence it is the interaction of agents (residents) within the envionemnt (cities). 
            A continue study in ABM would definately improve my capabilities to understand complicated urban planning concepts and processes.

            Agent-based Model simulates individual bodies' (agents) movements and interactions within in a given environment (wiki). 
            It emphasizes randomness in each interaction and helps understand detailed, specific situations which would not be examinated and discussed by triditioanl methodologies e.g. regression.

        It is an agent-based model including animated displays, real-time statistics in model , and parameter passings in interface. 
        It simulates the movements of sheep and wolf, as well as  and grassland for a duration.
        Sheep and wolf can move around grassland. Sheep can consume and store grass, 
        can also average their grass sotre with nearly individuals.
        Wolf can prey sheep, turn their colour into red, and stop sheep moving. 
        Initializing the model.py in spyder, it will show its UI. 
        Users can input parameters in the left panel then confirm through button, 
        else click "run" to start with initial parameters.
        When it runs, it is expected to show interactions between sheep wolf grassland, 
        and changes grassland, grass, and sheep corps by users,
        both in form of animation and statistics.

        <p>
            This small software implies important characteristics of object-based language in Python. These would be explained in relation to the code.
            Polymorphism: This characteristic allows the (abstruct) class Agent, an instance of Agent as a sheep in animation, 
            or multiple instances of Agent to call and use the same mothod of "move". This simplifies the structure of code.
            
            Scopes of variable:
            Python has 2 levels of global and local variables. Local variables like x, y, store, in class Agent will not be calculated by other elements in python, except class Agent itself. 

            variable passing:
            list:
            loop:
            class:
            encapsulation:
            module:
